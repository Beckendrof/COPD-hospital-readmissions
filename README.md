# Hospital Readmission 
## Objective

A hospital readmission is an episode when a patient who had been discharged from a hospital is admitted again within a specified time interval. Reducing hospital readmissions—especially those that result from poor inpatient or outpatient care—has long been a health policy goal because it represents an opportunity to lower health care costs, improve quality, and increase patient satisfaction at once. This project has been aimed towards building a predictive modelling system that predicts hospital readmissions for a patient diagnosed with COPD, within 30 days. 

## COPD

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. Symptoms include breathing difficulty, cough, mucus (sputum) production and wheezing.People with COPD are at increased risk of developing heart disease, lung cancer and a variety of other conditions.

Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common conditions that contribute to COPD. These two conditions usually occur together and can vary in severity among individuals with COPD.

## Why COPD

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide and has an associated treatment cost of $9,800 per patient per year in the US.1–3 Within 5 years of hospital discharge for a COPD exacerbation, the rehospitalization risk is 44%, and the mortality rate is 55.4% COPD affects more than 11 million Americans, and the disease prevalence among US veterans is 3-fold higher.

Patients hospitalized for COPD have a 30-day readmission rate of 22.6%

## Dataset being studied

The dataset being studied is the CMS linkable 2008–2010 Medicare Data Entrepreneurs’ Synthetic Public Use File (DE-SynPUF) which is publically available online. The data are fully “synthetic,” meaning no beneficiary in the DE-SynPUF is an actual Medicare beneficiary. The data set containse 20 samples for the years 2008-2010 and each sample has 5 types of files.
- CMS Beneficiary Summary DE-SynPUF
- CMS Inpatient Claims DE-SynPUF
- CMS Outpatient Claims DE-SynPUF
- CMS Carrier Claims DE-SynPUF (also known as the Physician/Supplier Part B claims file)
- CMS Prescription Drug Events (PDE) DE-SynPUF
